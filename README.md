# Black-Friday-Purchases-Prediction

ABC Private Ltd. wants to understand the behavior of their customers in order to better cater towards their needs.
They have shared all purchases of their high-volume products from the last month.
If only there’s a way to learn from the data...

## Motivation and Problem Significance

* Help “ABC Private Limited” understand customer purchasing behavior across product categories.
* Forecast future purchase amounts to enable more effective marketing strategies.
* Personalize offers and boost engagement with targeted promotions for specific customer segments.

## Intro to Our Data

This project was part of my role as project manager during the AI Student Collective fall cohort 2024. My goal as project manager was to help my group of beginner data science students understand core machine learning models and concepts.

To achieve this, I picked a synthetic data set that would let me demonstrate the steps of a machine learning pipeline.

### Data features

Customer Demographics:
* Gender
* Age
* Occupation
* Marital Status
* Length of stay in current city

Product Info:
* Product ID
* Product Categories (1, 2, and 3)
* Purchase Amount

## Getting Started:

### Dependencies

* Model Development: Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib
* Model Deployment: Streamlit, Pickle

### Installing
